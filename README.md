# Traffic_signal_classification
Trafic signal classification using LeNet architecture in keras
- In this case study, you have been provided with images of traffic signs and the goal is to train a Deep Network to classify them
- The dataset contains 43 different classes of images. 
- Classes are as listed below: 

    - ( 0, b'Speed limit (20km/h)') ( 1, b'Speed limit (30km/h)')
    - ( 2, b'Speed limit (50km/h)') ( 3, b'Speed limit (60km/h)')
    - ( 4, b'Speed limit (70km/h)') ( 5, b'Speed limit (80km/h)')
    - ( 6, b'End of speed limit (80km/h)') ( 7, b'Speed limit (100km/h)')
    - ( 8, b'Speed limit (120km/h)') ( 9, b'No passing')
    - (10, b'No passing for vehicles over 3.5 metric tons')
    - (11, b'Right-of-way at the next intersection') (12, b'Priority road')
    - (13, b'Yield') (14, b'Stop') (15, b'No vehicles')
    - (16, b'Vehicles over 3.5 metric tons prohibited') (17, b'No entry')
    - (18, b'General caution') (19, b'Dangerous curve to the left')
    - (20, b'Dangerous curve to the right') (21, b'Double curve')
    - (22, b'Bumpy road') (23, b'Slippery road')
    - (24, b'Road narrows on the right') (25, b'Road work')
    - (26, b'Traffic signals') (27, b'Pedestrians') (28, b'Children crossing')
    - (29, b'Bicycles crossing') (30, b'Beware of ice/snow')
    - (31, b'Wild animals crossing')
    - (32, b'End of all speed and passing limits') (33, b'Turn right ahead')
    - (34, b'Turn left ahead') (35, b'Ahead only') (36, b'Go straight or right')
    - (37, b'Go straight or left') (38, b'Keep right') (39, b'Keep left')
    - (40, b'Roundabout mandatory') (41, b'End of no passing')
    - (42, b'End of no passing by vehicles over 3.5 metric tons')
